# FreeCell-Solver
An A* program to solve FreeCell Solitaire in Java

This was part of a project for a class in AI. The professor, Dr. Dan DiTursi, provided much of playability for the game while I provided the heuristic, the A* search algorithm and some other methods to help find the solutions. All changes by me are marked in the file.
